We are well aware that coaching is a serious undertaking where one has to deal with
children with highly impressionable minds having varied interests and inclinations
and above all, plenty of distractions. They are forced to undergo tremendous stress
normally caused by peer pressure, parents’ expectations and their own dreams and
aspirations. Caught in an uneasy situation, they genuinely need professional
guidance &amp; support, close monitoring and incessant doses of positive verbal as well
as non-verbal strokes to keep them motivated and vibrant. We must assure you that
we handle these situations with comparative ease as our team has the required
experience &amp; expertise. We have created a highly conducive environment at our
centres where the factors of discipline and freedom are so finely blended that your
wards, deciding to take the arduous journey, go through it without grumbling. We
have the insight and sensitivity to look after the professional and psychological needs
of your ward with care and caution.
We must inform you that the routine and yet very important activities at our
centres e.g. Contact Classes, Doubt Removing Sessions. Periodical Tests, Setting
Question Papers, Evaluating Examination Answer Sheets, Preparing Results, Keeping
Track of Attendance, Checking Assignments, Conducting PTM, Updating Study
Material etc. are carried out under strict professional guidance and super vision.
There is no room for ambiguity, delay and error. The system, however, has in built
resilience to incorporate valuable suggestions from parents and students and
therefore, gets fine-tuned from time to time.

We admin that we are as ambitious as your wards and you are. We avow to continue
our end your towards building and strengthening of our nation in the noblest way.
We are fully prepared to take every measured, helps prepare the present generation
to take active part in all spheres of life and play their roles with sincerity, develop
commitment. Half the battle for us is won when we succeed in taking your wards to a
level where they learn to develop confidence in their ability to achieve, learn to take
responsibilities, remain steadfast on their goals, learn when they succeed and face
the temporary setbacks with re-inforced determination and grit.
We dream through your eyes and each time when you realize your dreams, our
dreams also come true.
We are sure you will continue to support us in this endeavour.
From all of us at Geenius, we wish you all the very best.

              In our Synchronised Program, students are prepared for Competitive Examinations along with their School / Board Examinations within the respective school premises of schools we are knowledge partner with. This saves ample of time for self – study and ultimately leads to crystal clarity of concepts. In fact no stone is left unturned in paving the way to success for students by preparing them for Competitive Examinations and school formal education (for Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) at the same time.
